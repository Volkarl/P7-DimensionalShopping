## Geo-Based Price Comparison & Scaling VPN Connected Services With Kubernetes

A software solution to examine price discrimination by online flight ticket vendors based on location and device information. The project is a scalable web service built on ASP.NET Core that sends requests to one of many NodeJS backend services. Any such backend is connected to a VPN and crawls the requested website with device information based on input. The backend and frontend are containerized applications deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, hosted by Microsoft Azure. The application is scalable with a low amount of user input and it can be conﬁgured to compare the prices of diﬀerent locations than its default. Currently it compares the prices of four different arrangements of VPN locations and device conﬁgurations to each other.
